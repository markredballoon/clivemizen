Simple and tiny Open Graph WordPress plugin to handle Facebook data.

== Description ==

This is a simple, tiny plugin to produce og:tags. Just that and only
that. No configuration, pure power.

Plugin grabs data from content and if contains YouTube URL, then plugin
try to get movie thumbnail and use it in og:image.

If post contains YouTube links, this plugin saves as post meta video
thumbnail link and add it to og:image as post thumbnail.

The Facebook Open Graph Tags inserted by this plugin are:

= for all type of content =

* og:locale - site locale
* og:site_name - blog title
* og:title - post/page/archive/tag/... title
* og:url - the post/page permalink
* og:type - "website" for the homepage, "article" for single content and blog for all others
* og:description - site description
* og:site_name - site name

= for single content =

* og:image: From a specific custom field of the post/page, or if not set from the post/page featured/thumbnail image, or if it doesn't exist from the first image in the post content, or if it doesn't exist from the first image on the post media gallery, or if it doesn't exist from the default image defined in the options menu. The same image chosen here will be used and enclosure/media:content on the RSS feed.

In this case:

og_og_title_value

    add_filter('og_og_title_value', 'my_og_og_title_value');
    function my_og_og_title_value($title)
    {
        if ( is_home() ) {
